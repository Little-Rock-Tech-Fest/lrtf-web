						p.title Do people who work my booth need a ticket?
						p Yes, your booth workers must be ticketed since we provide meals, swag and allow you to attend our evening events. If you want to send a different person for each day, they can share the same ticket but you will use one person's registration information and they will have to share event swag. If you are interested in purchasing a separate swag bag, let us know.
